ECG Signal Classification Using Deep Learning and Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization
To develop a robust framework for ECG signal classification leveraging the CPSC 2018 dataset, combining deep learning-based denoising, advanced feature extraction, and adaptive ensemble classifiers optimized with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The system aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in identifying arrhythmias.
